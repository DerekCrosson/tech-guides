# RSpec guides

RSpec is the most used testing tool in Ruby that we use here at Rootstrap.
You can check our guides:

* Do you want to know how to write specs? Check [RSpec Tutorial/Guide](tutorial.md)

* Maintaining specs could be hard when the amount of tests and developers that work/worked in the project increases, so we have to stick to a standard, check our [RSpec Style Guide](style_guide.md)
