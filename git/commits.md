Rules of a great Git commit message
===========

- Give a useful message (self-descriptive), avoid messages like: "Fix PR or bug"
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line, that is as if you were commanding someone. Start the line with "Fix", "Add", "Change" instead of "Fixed", "Added", "Changed".
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

Good commit messages serve at least three important purposes:

- To help the future maintainers, say five years into the future, to find out why a particular change was made to the code or why a specific feature was added.
- To help us write a good release note.
- To speed up the reviewing process.
